# I-EMS: Intelligent Engine Management System üöóüí®‚Üíüå±

> **AI-Powered Emissions Reduction at Traffic Signals**  
> *Turning Idling into Saving - One Red Light at a Time*

## üéØ The Problem

Across Europe, **3.3 billion liters of fuel** are wasted annually by vehicles idling at traffic signals. This creates:
- **7.6 million tons** of unnecessary CO‚ÇÇ emissions
- **‚Ç¨5 billion** in wasted fuel costs
- Significant NOx and particulate matter pollution

**Cultural Challenge:** Most European drivers don't switch off engines at signals due to convenience and habit.

## üí° Our Solution

I-EMS uses **real-time computer vision** to intelligently recommend engine shutdowns:


**Smart Logic:** Only recommends shutdown when:
- üö¶ Signal is **RED** 
- üöó **Less than 8 vehicles** ahead (signal will change soon)
- ‚ö° **Optimal conditions** for fuel savings

## üöÄ Quick Start
